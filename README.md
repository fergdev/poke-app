# INFO

Simple pokemon app that displays a list of pokemon that is selectable to show more information about that pokemon. 
Written in kotlin using ViewModel/LiveDate/DataBinding (MVVM) pattern, DI using Dagger, threading using CoRoutines, and networking using Retrofit/GSON. Test's were written for viewModels only.

# Improvements
Here are some improvements that can be done to the app.

* Add image loading animation with error state.
* Redo UI with a proper design :) :) :)
